# Using Weights & Biases (WandB) for Model Training

- Website: [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)
- Docs: [WandB Docs](https://docs.wandb.ai)

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn:

- How to set up WandB in your project
- Log metrics and model parameters during training
- Save and analyze experiment results

---

## 1. Installing and Setting Up WandB

First, install the WandB library:

```bash
pip install wandb
```

Then, log in to WandB using:

```bash
wandb login
```

This step will prompt you to authenticate with your WandB account.

## 2. Initializing WandB in training code

You can initialize WandB at the start of your script by defining a run and logging your configuration.

```python
import wandb
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Config:
    seed: int = 42
    epochs: int = 10
    batch_size: int = 32
    learning_rate: float = 0.001
    weight_decay: float = 1e-5
    model_path: str = "./checkpoints/best.pt"
    data_dir: str = "./datasets"
    device: str = "cuda"
    project_name: str = "vlai-pytorch-training"
    run_name: str = "experiment-1"

# Initialize WandB
def initialize_wandb(config: Config):
    wandb.init(
        project=config.project_name,
        name=config.run_name,
        config=config.__dict__,
    )
```

---

## 3. Logging Metrics and Parameters

During training, you can log metrics like loss, accuracy, or validation scores to WandB using `wandb.log`.

```python
def train_model(model, dataloaders, optimizer, lr_scheduler, config: Config):
    model = model.to(config.device)
    for epoch in range(config.epochs):
        # Simulate training loop
        train_loss, val_loss, val_acc = 0.5, 0.4, 0.85  # Example values
        
        # Log metrics to WandB
        wandb.log({
            "epoch": epoch,
            "train_loss": train_loss,
            "val_loss": val_loss,
            "val_accuracy": val_acc,
        })
```

## 4. See the visuliazations in WandB

After running your training script, you can view the results in your WandB dashboard.

## 5. Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to integrate WandB into your PyTorch training pipeline for logging metrics, saving models, and visualizing results.

Next, we will learn how to use Mixed Precision Training in PyTorch and apply it to your models. See [Mixed precision training](./6.Mixed_precision_training.md).
